# MMM-MapTracker
A live location tracking module for the Magic Mirror environment.
The module works in tandem with a custom mobile application that sends its coordinates continuously to the module's IP address.

This project was completed as a university thesis, and is only a proof-of-concept. The module is still a work-in-progress, and there are multiple areas and features I would like to improve before allowing anyone to use this.
